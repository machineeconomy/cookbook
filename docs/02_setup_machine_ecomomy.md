This is a tutorial for building your own machine economy with custom machines, energy providers and governments.

Our machine economy has three participants. A robot, a wind energy provider and an energy government. 

#### The use case
You can pay a robot for a service.
The robot will pay the energy for itself to the wind energy provider.
The government takes some taxes from the wind energy provider.
